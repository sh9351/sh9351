I'm currently working on **Nothing** - I just want some inner peace for now :cloud:  

But, I've previously worked on projects like [KTV](https://github.com/sh9351/ktv), [TripNode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_PE-_y5oh82YtDMwHRVMww/featured), etc.  

Ask me about programming, hacking, studying, etc. Just name it!  

I highly believe in the power of **open source** and **open access** - but the second one isn't limited to just research!  

You can reach me freely on my Discord via sh9351, or email at :email: hi@sh9351.me.  

Check out my [Korean portfolio](https://sh9351.me) for a bit more information, tho it's a bit outdated :cry:

For any DMCA takedown requests, removal of hacked content, or just anyone seeking to put me in jail, please reach out to me at 1-800-225-5324. You'll hear a response in under an hour or so.
